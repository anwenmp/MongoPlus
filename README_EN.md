#### ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥Use MyBatisPlus to elegantly operate MongoDB

* #### Sneak into the night with the wind

* #### Simplify development
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With simple configuration, CRUD operations can be quickly performed, and chain calls are more convenient

### Advantages:

* Non-invasive: Only enhancements are made without changes. Introducing it will not affect the existing project, as smooth as silk
* Low loss: Basics will be automatically injected upon startup CURD, basically no performance loss, direct object-oriented operation
* Powerful CRUD operation: General Service, most CRUD operations of a single table can be implemented with only a small amount of configuration, and there is a powerful conditional constructor to meet various usage needs
* Support Lambda form call: Through Lambda expressions, it is convenient to write various query conditions, no need to worry about the wrong field
* Support automatic generation of primary keys: Support up to 5 primary key strategies (including distributed unique ID generator - Sequence), which can be freely configured to perfectly solve the primary key problem
* Support operations without entity classes
* Support dynamic data sources
* Support logical deletion, prevent full collection update and deletion, automatic filling and other functions
